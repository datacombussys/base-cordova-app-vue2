*************************************** Questionnfor Elavon Jeffrey Bell *********************************************
Converge
If I schedule a recurring sale with Elavon, how Do I get the results of the sale? How am I notified? Can I make a API call to find result of Sale?
How do I process a recurring transaciton? I assume 1) Create token 2) ccaddrecurring sending token
Why does ccsale have a ssl-recurring-flag?
I thought i was supposed to use ccrecurringsale instead for transaction outside of the recurring frequency, and addrecurring automatically make the sales transaciton inside the frequency.
ConvergeSDK
How do I properly setConfiguration and getConfiguration
A property in setConfiguraiton is printers: "EPSON". How is this possible if it is not listed int he docs as suooprted? STAR is supported

Should I do recurring Sales in Elavon or handle them myself each month?
It looks like I can capture card data "On-Demand" then send that data to elavon via Converge. Passing hte track info in the API call instead of ConvergeSDK?

Is CVV required? The docs say that it is not, however, I am unable to make a sucessful API call without ut. Error code 4007
